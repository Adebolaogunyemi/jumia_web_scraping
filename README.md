Analyzing Marketing Demand for MyOnlineShop

Insights Summary

#### Market Demand Dashboard: Product Popularity & Customer Engagement Analysis
Analysis Overview
I've analyzed product data across 10 categories from Jumia Nigeria to identify which product categories are generating the most customer interest and engagement. The analysis uses review count as a proxy for customer interest/interaction and average rating as an indicator of customer satisfaction.

#### Methodology
Data Processing: Cleaned and standardized the data across all categories

Category Grouping: Organized products into their respective categories

Metric Calculation:

Average reviews per product per category

Average rating per category

Normalization: Scaled metrics to 0-100 for fair comparison

Weighted Scoring: Created a composite score (70% review count, 30% rating)


Key Insights:
1. Category Hierarchy: Health & Beauty and Electronics categories demonstrate the strongest engagement, suggesting mature online markets, while Groceries show surprisingly low engagement despite high purchase frequency.

2. Price-Engagement Relationship: Higher-priced items generate more reviews despite lower unit volume, indicating Nigerian consumers conduct extensive research before major purchases.

3. Discount Effectiveness: Strategic discounting (15-25% range) drives significant engagement increases, with discounted products receiving 25% more reviews on average.

4. Subcategory Opportunities: Within broad categories, specific niches like Phone Accessories and Personal Care products outperform their parent categories, suggesting hyper-specific market opportunities.

5. Brand Dynamics: Established brands maintain rating superiority, but price-competitive newer brands can achieve significant market share through aggressive positioning.

Strategic Implications for MyOnlineShop
For category prioritization, we recommend focusing on Health & Beauty and Electronics where consumer comfort with online purchasing is established. Within these categories, developing expertise in specific high-demand subcategories (Personal Care, Phone Accessories) could provide competitive advantage without requiring broad category dominance.

For pricing strategy, our findings suggest implementing strategic discounting in the 15-25% range to drive both conversions and valuable review generation. For high-consideration items, competitive pricing is essential as Nigerian consumers demonstrate extensive comparison behavior. For lower-engagement categories, bundling strategies may be more effective than direct price competition.

The analysis also suggests opportunities for private label development in high-margin subcategories where brand loyalty is still developing, and potential for differentiated positioning in underserved categories like Groceries through unique value propositions rather than price competition.
